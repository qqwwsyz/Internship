Task 3
Using window size as a parameter, for example, for window size = 10 
Test script runs as	
python3 .receiver.py 5004 10  RECEIVED_FILE &
python3 .forwarder.py 5002 5004 &
cat SMALL_FILE  python3 .sender.py 127.0.0.1 5002 10 &

After test 10 data points from 5 to 14 as 10 different window sizes, and repeatedly experimented at least 5 times with mean values of transmisson time and count the average speed.

The statistical data shows as below

window size = 5
Sent 10491 bytes in 46.839 seconds in average 0.224 kBs

window size = 6
Sent 10491 bytes in 46.533 seconds in average 0.225 kBs

window size = 7
Sent 10491 bytes in 47.856 seconds in average 0.219 kBs

window size = 8
Sent 10491 bytes in 51.942 seconds in average 0.202 kBs

window size = 9
Sent 10491 bytes in 45.013 seconds in average 0.233 kBs

window size = 10
Sent 10491 bytes in 44.053 seconds in average 0.238 kBs

window size = 11
Sent 10491 bytes in 45.024 seconds in average 0.233 kBs

window size = 12
Sent 10491 bytes in 50.318 seconds in average 0.208 kBs

window size = 13
Sent 10491 bytes in 46.221 seconds in average 0.227 kBs

window size = 14
Sent 10491 bytes in 46.676 seconds in average 0.225 kBs
As statistical

We can concludes that setting window size = 10 result in highest throughput.
